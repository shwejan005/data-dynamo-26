# Welcome to the AI Video Orchestrator

**Turn your core brand identity into fully produced marketing videos—automatically.**

## How It Works

This system is powered by a **Multi-Agent Orchestrator (Gemini 3)** that guides you through a seamless, iterative creation process.

### 1. **Context & Onboarding**
You start by providing your **Brand DNA**—name, logo, colors, and the target duration for your campaign. Our Orchestrator memorizes this context to ensure every decision moving forward is perfectly aligned with your brand identity.

### 2. **Intelligent Planning**
Whether you upload a PDF or type a rough idea, our **Planning Agent** analyzes your inputs to structure a compelling narrative. Unsure about the direction? The system proactively offers intelligent suggestions to keep you moving.

### 3. **Character & Aesthetic Design**
- **Style Selection**: Choose the exact look and feel for your video.
- **Advanced Character Gen**: Powered by **Nano Banana Pro**, we generate consistent character profiles from four distinct angles (Front, Side, 3/4, Back), ensuring your characters look exactly the same in every scene.

### 4. **Script & Asset Production**
Once your script is finalized, the system automatically provisions all necessary visual assets:
- **Outfit References**: Consistent styling for your characters.
- **Locations**: detailed visual environments.

### 5. **Video Generation (Veo 3)**
The **Veo 3 Agent** takes over to generate high-fidelity video scenes (up to 8s each). The Orchestrator then intelligently stitches these clips together into a cohesive, professional marketing video.

### 6. **Automated Distribution**
Finally, our **Social Agent** handles the logistics—either publishing directly to your platforms or queuing the video for your final review.
