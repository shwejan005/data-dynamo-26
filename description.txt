We built an end-to-end system that turns a single security awareness PDF into a finished compliance training video using a multi-agent, tool-driven pipeline orchestrated by Gemini 3 as the central reasoning and state management agent; Gemini 3 first parses and summarizes the PDF, generates a structured training script, plans scenes, extracts locations, characters, and outfits, and maintains a persistent asset registry, then calls Nana Banana Pro to generate all visual assets including four-angle character references, location backgrounds, outfit variants, and scene thumbnails to ensure identity and style consistency, and finally calls Veo 3.1 to generate short, conditioned video clips for each scene, which are stitched together deterministically into a final video; this process typically involves over 25–40 tool calls across phases for PDF understanding, script generation, scene planning, asset creation, thumbnail validation, video generation, and selective regeneration loops, enabling an iterative workflow where any script line, scene, location, or outfit can be regenerated independently while preserving global consistency, resulting in a fully automated pipeline from document ingestion to downloadable training video using Gemini 3 for planning and control, Nana Banana Pro for images, and Veo 3.1 for video.
